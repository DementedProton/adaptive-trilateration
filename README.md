WALE: A Weighted Adaptive Location Estimation Algorithm

# ** abstract
indoor Localization using Wi-Fi is gaining ubiquitous usage owing to its simplicity and inexpensiveness. A conventional method of localization is trilateration which can be accomplished using signal strength or time of ﬂight of a radio signal between reciever and transmitter. However trilateration is prone to errors in accuracy which can occur due to various factors. Commonly, a reason for the failure of trilateration is due to the errors in distance estimation which makes the quality of trilateration poor. In this paper, we propose a novel Weighted Adaptive Location Estimation (WALE) algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of localization over the basic trilateration by taking into account the quality and properties of the circle overlaps in the trilateration region. Based on the overlap properties a distance reestimation, and classiﬁcation of points based on whether they are trilaterable is performed. A maximum likelihood estimation over a weighted grid of this region based on an exponential distribution provides the location estimate. Our experiments over real indoor testbeds have demonstrated that our algorithm provides much improved accuracies without ﬁngerprinting both in the average and worst case.
